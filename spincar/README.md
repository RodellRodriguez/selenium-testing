# Spin Car Demo

Quick Selenium test in Python for SpinCar's [Schedule Demo page](https://info.spincar.com/360-demo-2) with the Firefox web browser. I also used the unittest library with Seleneium to execute the tests.

In specific I did a single test to check if the "Please complete all required fields." error message displays after filling out only the first name and last name fields of the Schedule Demo form.

This was to demonstrate a couple of skills, some of which to highlight: usage of Page Object Model pattern, seperating test data and the test itself, and identifying elements with CSS selector and element name.

Feel free to let me know of any critiques of my code!
